## What is an elevation drawings and the benefits of having one?

An“elevation” is a drawing that shows the front or side of something (2D). A floor plan, by contrast, shows a space from above – as if you are looking down on the room from the ceiling. Thus, you see the tops of everything, but you cannot view the front, side or back of an object. An elevation gives you the chance to see everything from the other viewpoints.

Elevations are essential in kitchen design, as well as other detailed renovations. Without elevation drawings, you cannot see the details of your new cabinetry, the size of each drawer or the location of each cabinet. A floor plan simply cannot communicate all of this information adequately.

### Tools & materials you need:
1. Scale Ruler
2. Pencil or Pen 
3. Paper
4. Measuring Tape
5. A mindful, clear and focused mind

### Ways to draw your kitchen out:
Here are things to take note of when drawing your kitchen:
1. All the confirmed appliances sizes your client will be using. ( This would be easy if you had done it in the appliances section )  From the sizes, you can plot the dimensions they will require within the kitchen space. 
2. Most custom carpentry sizes can go as big and as small as you intend. But a good point is to ask yourself if the size you intend to propose are able to cater for all the appliances you want within the space? For example: -Most kitchen doors are advisable to be at estimated 500mm length. Can you see why? Anything more than 500mm can possibly hinder opening ergonomics. 
3. It is advisable to indicate the direction of each doors opening. 
4. Are the doors going to have handles? Otherwise are you proposing finger grips instead? These details should also be reflected in the drawing.
5. Who are supplying the handles, dish-racks and all other mechanisms? Be sure to communicate this details to your client to avoid any miscommunication. 
6. Indicate in drawing if lights / LED  are required as carpenter will need to cater space for the LED strips to run along the desired areas. 
7. Indicate in drawings where all the switches / plugs are to be placed. This will provide clarity for installers.
