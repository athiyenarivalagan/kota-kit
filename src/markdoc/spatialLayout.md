## Guidelines & Checklist

Things to take note of when planning for spatial planning:

1. Structural Beams- The original floorplan from HDB / management would usually indicate which walls are structural. When these structural beams have been identified, you should avoid hacking or tempering these walls. Your design proposals should then accommodate to these areas accordingly. 

2. Ergonomics of Interior- In order to create good spatial layout, you need to have a good sense of this. At its core, ergonomics simply means the study of how a human being interacts with something else. For interior designers, this means how a human being interacts with their surroundings, spatially.

For example, a minimum of 60 to 70cm is usually catered for all walkways, ie spaces between your

- Kitchen and island
- On the left and right side of the bed

When planning for spatial layout, we see the overview of the house from birds view. When looking at this angle, we would be able to plan for how we want to positions our TV console, sofa or even bed. Here are some guidelines you can use to help you make better decisions. 

#1. For start, you can use the Standard Furniture Sizes to base all your furniture and appliances at this planning stage until you or your client have confirmed on the specific models and types. [Click here for example](https://www.thespruce.com/standard-furniture-measurements-1391374)

# Custom Made Furnitures: Depths

When you or your clients are intending to custom make any furnitures, while the total lengths of how much kitchen youd want fill throughout the kitchen, it is the opposite for its depth. There are a couple of standard custom depth sizes that have already been set by the common industry contractors based on common ergonomics. Below are some examples:

**In the Kitchen:**
- Bottom Cabinet: 60cmD
- Top Cabinet : 30cmD
- Kitchen Peninsula: 60cmD

**In the Bathroom:**
- Mirror Vanity Cabinet: 25cm 
- Sink Cabinet: 40 - 50cmD

**Unique Custom Carpentries:**
- Kitchen Islands: 60cmD to 2mD
- Study Tables: 60cmD to 1m

Tips: When planning the spatial layout, put yourself in the users shoes- Imagine how would you use the space? A good reference is also to go back to users existing / current spatial ergonomics. Question how effective they are or if there are rooms for more improvements. Question what do they dislike or love most about that arrangement. Would you want to reuse the same layout? 

Remember that your previous experience can be of great reference for a more conducive environment in your new home. 

With a drawn to scale HDB floorplan you will be able to start planning how your spatial layout is going to be. To do so- draw the furnitures you intending to use (to size into the layout) What you can get out of doing this is:
1. Determining the walkways space
2. If adding or removing or rotating some furnitures makes better ergonomic sense.

**Tools & material you will need:**

1. To size floorplan from HDB / Agent / Previous Owner
2. Ruler
3. Pencil / Erasable Pen / Pen
4. Measuring Tape ( Having your measuring tape will be of good use to imaging how long certain size would be )
5. A list of universal furniture sizes / OR the be even exact, gather the list of all the furniture sizes you will be using for the new house.
6. An explorative, clear and focused mind

**Here are some of questions to ask yourself when working on the spatial layout:**
- Is the space enough to walk? At least 50 - 60cm walkway
- What is the priority activity for each of these areas?
- Does the size allow for you to accommodate for you desired vision? If not, how should you compromise?
- Would it be better for me to use a Q / K / Single Bed ? 
- Would it be better to use a 4 / 6 / 8 dinning table ? 

**When planning for Kitchens spatial layout:**
Use all the universal sizes as reference to how much space you will need to allocate for:
- Hood: est 90cmW
- Hob: 86cmW
- Oven: 56cmW
- Microwave: 50cmW
- A Tall Unit: 60cmW
- Kitchen Sink: 70-90cm (Choose according to preference) 
When properly done, all future instances may possibly be planned ahead of time.

**Additional question to ask: Are you planning to hack the walls to create more space? 

**If so, here are some low-downs to take note of:**
- No hacking is allowed on all structural beams
- When hacking walls, your floor will also be affected.
- So, how do you intent to repair the flooring? Will you have the budget to remove only the affected floorings or Will you have the budget to redo the entire area? * This can affect the overall house aesthetics.
- If you are certain on the hacking works, have you prepared the paperworks to be submitted to HDB? Refer to the hdb link on the paperworks required to be filled.

**Tools and materials you will need:**
1. All the filled forms and paperworks required and submitted to the respective propertyâ€™s management HDB / MCST
2. A critical mind to think about all the areas that will be affected by the hacking work- Flooring, Beams, Walls, Water Pipe, Gas Pipes.
