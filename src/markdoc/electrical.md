# Guidelines

It is a type of technical drawing that delivers visual representation and describes circuits and electrical systems. It consists of electrical symbols and lines that showcase the engineer's electrical design to its clients. In short, an electrical plan describes the position of all the electrical apparatus.


Why is there a need to have an electrical plan or drawing? You must be thinking why to splurge on a precise electrical plan. The purposes of an electrical plan are as follows:


- These drawings are vital for documenting, communicating information, and troubleshooting your power systems on-site.
- Accurate and updated drawings keep your building in compliance with all the code regulations.
- A plan encompasses all aspects. It focuses on areas such as lighting, electronics, appliances, etc.
- It also considers the structure of the building. For example, if a building has railings, stairs, or any other components, modifications will be made accordingly.
- It is a thorough planning tool because it gives an in-depth view of your building's electrical and wiring system.
- It helps to distribute power to various appliances and equipment through accurate operation and installation of elements.
- It helps to ensure that your system runs safely, efficiently, and smoothly.
- An electrical plan saves time by avoiding delays and problems. A draft pinpoints everything to prevent hazardous situations; thereby, it helps professionals to complete their work on time.
- It also saves money because nobody feels like spending more money than they already have. A draft includes all the details like wire's length, type of cables, and other parts you will need to complete your project. Thus, you do not have to spend a considerable amount of money on unnecessary things.

# How to create an electrical plan?

An excellent electric plan significantly adds aesthetics and comfort in a building. Your drawing must include types of fixtures, locations, cables, switches, and hardwired appliances. However, an electrical plan may look scary and complicated, but they are not. These are pointers you should remember while drafting an electric plan.

## 1. Use your confirmed spatial layout. 
Around your exits and entries, place your fan, AC switches, and light. Now, place your electrical outlets near the counters and tables. Then, decide where to put your big appliances like TV, computer, washing machine, printer, etc.

When making an electrical plan, ask yourself some questions:

- Do I place switches at a convenient location?
- Is the electrical load on all the circuit alright?
- Do I place enough easy-to-reach receptacles?

### 2. Know the right electrical terms and plan for them accordingly within the space.

- Wall Switches - for heaters, ovens, cooker hood & hobs etc
- Electrical outlets (also known as outlets, electrical sockets, plugs, and wall plugs) - for microwave, TVs, phone charging, game consoles etc
- Lighting Points - light points are where the wiring runs to provide power for your light fittings, LED strips lights, cove lights, down / spotlights etc.

*Disclaimer:-
1. Resale = Exposed Trunkings 
2. BTOS / Condos = Concealed Trunkings
3. For most desing and build contractor costings, adequate number of switches or new plugs are included in the package so check and think about how many more additional points or plugs you would need to for each designed space.
