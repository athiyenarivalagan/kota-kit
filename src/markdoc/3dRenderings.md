## What is a 3D renderings?
3D rendering is the process of creating a photorealistic 2D image from 3D models. 3D rendering is the final step in the process of 3D visualization, which involves creating models of objects, texturing those objects, and adding lighting to the scene. 

The more information you have, the more it helps 3d artists to understand your design clearly and execute the process quicker. Every time if there are missing pieces during the process, 3d visualizers have to search, ask, wait, confirm, those are counted as time wasted and time is money.

In most cases, interior designer would outsource this service but you would also have the skills to generate your own renderings. Nevertheless, below are preparation steps to ease and aid the whole rendering process. 

## Tools & materials you need:

1. Spatial Layout (or Final CAD) - the best source for the 3d designers to start analyzing and modelling accurately. Refer to your final Spatial Layout here. [ *backend to link to spatial page ]
2. Material List - the best source for the 3d designers to download and incorporate materials accurately. Refer to your Final Material List here. [ *backend to link to material page ]
3. Appliances List - the best source for the 3d designers to download and incorporate appliances models accurately. Refer to your Final Appliances List here. [ *backend to link to appliances page ]
4. Indications of preferred camera angles/ locations- specified camera angles in the floor plan
5. Concept Board - the best source for the 3d designers to download and incorporate appliances models accurately. Refer to your Final Concept Board here. [ *backend to link to concept page ]
6. Additional assets - Quick drawing or a hand sketch or 3D props like SketchUp, max, cad. revit etc.
