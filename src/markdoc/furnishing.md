# Guidelines 

When it's time to choose one concept, ask yourself questions to decide which of your concepts works best with the site, your clients, and the story they want to tell. Sometimes this will point you to an obvious choice and sometimes it won't. When it doesn't, do your best to make a choice and go with it.
